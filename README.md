# Vehicle Rental System
This repository contains a simple Vehicle Rental System implemented in Java. The application calculates the rental cost for different types of vehicles and generates an invoice for the customer.

## Overview
The main functionality of this system includes:

- Calculating the rental cost based on the type of vehicle and the rental period.
- Generating an invoice with details such as vehicle information, rental period, costs, and customer details.

In my implementation, the CalculateRentalCost method calculates the rental cost based on the vehicle type and rental period, while the GenerateInvoice method generates an invoice with all the rental details.
